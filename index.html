            <h4>Bombing Palestinians displaced from Gaza City</h4>
            <p>Within a specific strategy, Israel tried to completely displace the population of the northern Gaza Strip towards the south. It launched dozens of air strikes to push them towards displacement. Israeli planes also dropped leaflets on the cities and towns of the north asking the Palestinians to leave for the south.  The United Nations considered the occupation army’s decision to be a clear and explicit violation of the laws of war and human rights.
                The air strikes came at a time when Israel ordered all residents of northern Gaza to move south. While dozens of Palestinian civilians were moving in cars and trucks, the Israeli Air Force bombed the convoys, killing 70 people, most of them women and children. Air strikes also continued on areas in the south that were requested.  Mainly civilians displaced there</p>

            <h4>Starvation imposed by Israel kills children</h4>
            <p>“The Israeli government’s use of starvation as a weapon of war is proven to be killing children in Gaza,” said Omar Shaker, Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. “Israel must end this war crime, stop this suffering, and allow humanitarian aid to reach all parts of Gaza unhindered.”
                The Gaza Ministry of Health said that as of April 1, 32 people, including 28 children, had died of malnutrition and dehydration in hospitals in northern Gaza.  On April 2, Save the Children confirmed that 27 children had died from hunger and disease.  Previously, in March, WHO officials found “children dying of starvation” in the Kamal Adwan and Al-Awda hospitals in northern Gaza.  In southern Gaza, where aid is more available but still largely insufficient, UN agencies said in mid-February that 5% of children under the age of two were suffering from acute malnutrition.</p>

            <p>The Baptist Hospital massacre, also known as the Arab National Hospital massacre, is a massacre committed by the Israeli Air Force when it raided the Arab National Hospital “Al-Baptist” in the Al-Zaytoun neighborhood, south of Gaza City, in the early night hours of October 17, 2023. The raid hit  Violent Israeli air strikes in the hospital courtyard, which contained dozens of wounded, as well as hundreds of displaced civilians, most of whom were women and children.  The Israeli massacre caused a real disaster.  It tore apart the bodies of the victims and made them scattered and burned, while the hospital turned into a pool of blood, and the international community until this moment has been silent and compliant with Israel despite its crimes against humanity and in violation of international laws and human and children’s rights, and it is estimated that between 200 and 300 Palestinian civilians were killed in the bombing.  The Israeli who deliberately targeted the Baptist Hospital, which was filled to the brim with displaced civilians and victims of Israeli raids</p>

            <p>International humanitarian law prohibits starvation of civilians as a method of warfare.  The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court states that intentionally starving civilians “by depriving them of items indispensable to their survival, including intentionally impeding relief supplies,” constitutes a war crime.

            Since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks against Israel, the Israeli government has deliberately blocked the delivery of aid, food, and fuel to Gaza, obstructed humanitarian aid, and deprived civilians of the means to survive.  Israeli officials who order or carry out these actions are committing collective punishment against the civilian population and practicing starvation of civilians as a method of war, both of which are war crimes.

            <p>Israel has a long history of propaganda, fabrication, and attempts at evasion, the least of which is the Baptist National Hospital massacre.
                It declared that it was not responsible for this bombing and pointed the finger of blame at Palestinian factions on the basis that the rockets were fired from within the Gaza Strip.
                The occupation army spokesman admitted to bombing the garage of Baptist Hospital, in a new contradiction to the Israeli story, which denied targeting the hospital or its sides at all, but he claimed that the targeting did not cause direct injuries to the hospital.  The speaker published what he said was an intercepted audio call between two members of Hamas talking about the subject of the massacre. In the audio recording promoted by Israel, the first says to the second that the missile was probably made by the Jihad movement and fell accidentally on its part. However, this recording has been exposed to many  Criticisms are particularly the orderly and organized way of speaking, where the first caller waits for his second counterpart to finish his entire sentence so he can begin and then waits for the other party in the same way and so on, in addition to the calmness that was described as strange in the call even though the occurrence of a massacre of this size is a serious matter.</p>
